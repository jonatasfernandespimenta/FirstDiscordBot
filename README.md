This is my first Discord bot using python, I'm still learning how to do things with it, so it's kinda messy.

To test it you just need to create an account at discord and go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
there you create your new Bot and insert the given token at
```python
client.run(here)
```
And then you just need to add the bot to your server.
